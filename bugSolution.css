The following CSS rule fixes the issue by correctly specifying the attribute and value in the selector:

```css
data-my-attr="value"] {
  /* styles here */
}
```

Ensure the attribute `data-my-attr` exists on the target element and has the value "value" to see the styles applied.  Always double-check attributes and values for typos and correctness when using attribute selectors in CSS.
